ocpp-codec - OCPP messages encoder
==================================

_ocpp-codec_ provides dataclasses definitions of OCPP messages and types, in both version 1.6 and 2.0 of the protocol.

It also provides a JSON encoder to exchange messages.

It **does not** provide an API to write an OCPP server or client.
